# How User Claims Are Populated in ASP.NET Core with JWT

## Overview
When a client sends a request to a protected API endpoint with a JWT (JSON Web Token) in the `Authorization` header, ASP.NET Core's authentication middleware validates the token and populates the user's claims. These claims are then accessible throughout the request lifecycle via `HttpContext.User`.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **JWT Token Issuance**
   - When a user logs in (e.g., via your AuthController), the server generates a JWT containing claims (such as the user's ID, email, etc.).
   - Example claim in the token:
     - `sub` (subject): the user's unique ID
     - `email`: the user's email address

2. **Client Sends JWT**
   - The client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header of each request:
     ```http
     Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
     ```

3. **Authentication Middleware**
   - The JWT Bearer authentication middleware (configured in `Program.cs` with `.AddAuthentication().AddJwtBearer(...)`) intercepts the request.
   - It validates the token's signature, issuer, audience, and expiration.
   - If valid, it parses the claims from the token.

4. **ClaimsPrincipal Population**
   - The middleware creates a `ClaimsPrincipal` object from the token's claims.
   - This object is assigned to `HttpContext.User` for the duration of the request.

5. **Accessing Claims in Code**
   - Anywhere in the request pipeline (controllers, services, repositories), you can access the user's claims:
     ```csharp
     var userId = _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext?.User.FindFirstValue(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier);
     ```
   - This retrieves the user's ID from the `NameIdentifier` claim (usually mapped from the `sub` claim in the JWT).

## Why This Matters
- This mechanism allows you to securely identify the user making the request and enforce authorization rules.
- It enables per-user data access, auditing, and personalization.

## Example: How It Works in Your App
- You generate a JWT with the user's ID as a claim during login.
- The client sends this token with each request.
- The middleware validates the token and populates `HttpContext.User`.
- Your code can then safely access the user's ID and other claims for business logic.

---

**Summary:**
- JWT claims are parsed and loaded into `HttpContext.User` automatically by the authentication middleware.
- You can access these claims anywhere in your app to identify and authorize the user.
